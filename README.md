### Pre-extracted Image Features

### Raw Images

Training and testing on CIRR does not require the raw images. However, should you prefer to acces them, please refer to our image source [NLVR2](https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/nlvr/).

**Note**: we do not recommend downloading the images by URLs ([provided here](https://github.com/lil-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2#downloading-the-images)), as it contains too many broken links. Instead, we suggest to follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/lil-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2#direct-image-download) to directly access the images. To quote the authors:

>To obtain access, please fill out the linked [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/yS29stWnFWzrDBFH3). This form asks for your basic information and asks you to agree to our Terms of Service. We will get back to you within a week. If you have any questions, please email `nlvr@googlegroups.com`.
