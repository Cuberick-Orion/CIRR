## Composed Image Retrieval on Real-life Images

We expand the task of *composed image retrieval* by introducing the **C**omposed **I**mage **R**etrieval on **R**eal-life images (CIRR) dataset - the first dataset of open-domain, real-life images with human-generated modification sentences.

Concurrently, we release the code for our baseline method **C**omposed **I**mage **R**etrieval using **P**retrained **LAN**guage **T**ransformers (CIRPLANT).
